"Library" To be included in this project:
 *Random*

How to import?
 Just type - import Random
 OR you can give it an Alias as : "import Random as rd" (It will reduce the time to type RANDOM every time, instead of typing 'Random' just type 'rd')
 
From random library we need to import randint method. 
So we can write: "from random inport randint as ri".
